                <p>The first time I started coding in JavaScript was overwhelming, but at the same time invigorating. I’ve always been one to go outside and take to the trail, and thought that I’d be the last one to ever be staring at a computer all day trying to make sense of all these different programming languages. I did realize how rewarding building, editing, debugging, and publishing your own piece of software would be. So here I am, with only a fraction of understanding of this realm thus far, but it’s all starting to come together piece by piece, day by day. Everyday I learn something new, and want to push that concept as far as I can to see how far the rabbit hole really goes. There is no end to it all, the possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see how far I can go. For now this webpage is a collective of my newly developed computer languages, and will only become more sophisticated as time goes on.</p>
